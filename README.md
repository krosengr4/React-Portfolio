## Description
This professional portfolio of Kevin Rosengren is made as a single page application made with React js. Within the portfolio, a user will first land on the about me page where they can read a short section about me. At the top of the page is a header with My name, and navigation links to contact me, portfolio, and resume pages. At the bottom of the page the user will see a footer with three logos that go to my linkedIn, github profile, and instagram. On the portfolio page a user can view some of my recent projects as well go visit the page by clicking the picture link. On the contact me page, a user can write their name, email, and a message that they would like to send to my email. Lastly on the resume page, a user can download my resume by clicking the logo.
